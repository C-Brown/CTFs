Nothing in the description, the challenge title led to googling since i didnt know what lynxve was..  its a text based browser.


Looking into it's functionality and options.  There is a setting for the bookmarks file which stands out as something I should look into to read from the filesystem.


I set a bookmark with 'a', check the bookmarks list with 'v', then press backspace to go back, which shows me a listing of the various pages i've looked at.


in that listing it says:

"file://localhost/home/ctf/bookmarks.html"


Lets just change that to a folder and see if we can list out the directory.

"file://localhost/home/ctf/" 


it gives us the directory listing with a file called "flag" in it.


"file://localhost/home/ctf/flag"
