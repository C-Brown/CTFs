-made by awg 
hint: may need to sort by new

I don't remember where I had already seen the name Alex Gaines but I had seen that awg -> Alex Gaines.

The challenge name is presentor, saying he was at a conference.. probably related to him presenting at a con.

Googling leads to youtube video of alex gaines presentation on "object diversification with the help of r2"

In comments, it only shows 1 comment at first until you sort by new and it shows 3 total comments, which had me stuck for a while because i completely forgot about the hint...

Comment tells us that the flag is:
> WPI{@wg_1s4ch@nNAMEHERE} and we have to replace NAMEHERE with what he calls the inserted code bits in the presentation-- which is CRUFTABLES

WPI{@wg_1s4ch@nCRUFTABLES}
