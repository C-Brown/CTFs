The description just says "can you find it?"  the challenge name should be hint enough.  

run dnsrecon on wpictf.xyz and look at the TXT record:


```
dnsrecon -d wpictf.xyz

in TXT record [*]      TXT wpictf.xyz V1BJezFGMHVuZF9UaDNfRE5TLXJlY29yZH0=
```

This decodes to:
WPI{1F0und_Th3_DNS-record}
